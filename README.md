Project Report: Password Generator

 1. Project Description
This project implements a password generator tool that allows the user to customize various aspects of the generated password, such as length, character types, and inclusion of custom characters. Additionally, it evaluates the strength of the generated password based on predefined criteria and provides feedback on the password’s strength.

 2. Design Choices

- Input Parameters:
  The program prompts the user for several inputs that affect the password generation:
  - Min and Max Length: These values define the range of the password length.
  - Character Types: Users can choose to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special symbols in the password.
  - Custom Characters: Users can input their own set of characters that should be included in the password.

- Password Generation Logic:
  The password is randomly generated based on the provided character sets. The characters are drawn randomly from the possible pool based on the user’s choices.

- Password Strength Evaluation:
  The program assesses the strength of the generated password based on the following criteria:
  - Minimum length of 12 characters for strength.
  - Presence of at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special symbol.
  - The strength is rated as "Very Strong", "Strong", "Moderate", or "Weak" based on how many of the criteria the password satisfies.

 3. Algorithms and Data Structures

- Randomness:
  - The Random class is used to generate random values to select characters for the password and to determine its length within the specified range.

- Data Structures:
  - StringBuilder is used to handle both the character pool and the generated password due to its efficiency in handling string concatenation in Java.
  - A Random object is used for generating random selections from the character pool.

 4. Challenges Encountered

- Ensuring Password Diversity:
  Initially, the password was being generated purely randomly from the entire pool of characters. This sometimes resulted in passwords with missing required character types . To mitigate this, the algorithm was refined to ensure that the password contains at least one character from each selected category before generating the rest randomly.

- Handling User Input:
  Ensuring that user input was validated and handled correctly was challenging. The program assumes a correct input format , and improper input could lead to errors. This was handled by using .equals("y") to convert user input into boolean flags.

- Password Length Control:
  Initially, the password length was not sufficiently randomized or controlled, which could lead to passwords that were too short. The solution was to use a random value within the range of the min and max lengths provided by the user.

 5. Improvements Made to the Initial Implementation

- Character Pool Refinement:
  The program was modified to ensure that, if the user requests certain character types , at least one character from each selected type is included in the password. This ensures diversity in the generated password.
  
- Incorporating Custom Characters:
  Custom characters provided by the user are now properly incorporated into the password generation process, allowing for more personalized password creation.

- Enhanced Strength Check:

The strength check algorithm was adjusted to give more specific feedback on the password strength by considering the presence of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. Passwords shorter than 12 characters are flagged as weak, and passwords with missing character categories are rated lower.

 6. File Usage

No files were used for input or output in this implementation. All inputs and outputs are handled via the command-line interface . The program prompts the user for input interactively and displays the generated password and its strength directly to the console. 

If the program were to be extended to use files, one possible enhancement could be to read user preferences from a configuration file, and save the generated password or password strength assessment to an output file for later use.

 7. Additional Explanations

- Strength Categories: 
  The password strength is classified into four categories: 
  - Very Strong: Meets all criteria (length, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols).
  - Strong: Meets three out of four criteria.
  - Moderate: Meets two out of four criteria.
  - Weak: Meets fewer than two criteria.

- Random Password Length: 
  The random length for the password ensures that the generated password is unpredictable and fits within the desired range, improving security.

- Custom Character Input: 
  The inclusion of custom characters is a flexible feature, allowing users to include specific characters they prefer in their password generation.

 Conclusion
This password generator allows users to customize the generated password based on their specific requirements. The combination of randomness and user control provides a balance between security and personalization. The strength evaluation ensures that users are aware of the security level of the passwords they create, making it easier for them to choose stronger passwords. Future improvements could involve refining input handling, allowing file-based configurations, and enhancing security features such as entropy analysis.
